            <p>Edward Snowden is a former intelligence contractor who gained international attention in 2013 when he
                leaked classified documents revealing the global surveillance programs conducted by the United States
                National Security Agency (NSA).</p>
            <p>Snowden's disclosures exposed the extent of mass surveillance, including the collection of phone records
                and internet communications of millions of people worldwide. His courage in revealing these practices
                led to a significant reevaluation of privacy rights and government accountability.</p>
            <p>Edward Snowden's actions have had a lasting impact on the conversation around digital privacy and civil
                liberties. Some see him as a hero for exposing government overreach, while others view him as a traitor.
                Regardless of one's perspective, there is no denying the profound impact Snowden has had on the ongoing
                discourse about the balance between national security and individual privacy.</p>
